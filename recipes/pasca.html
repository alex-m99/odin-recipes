    <p>
      Paska breads are a traditional element in the Easter holidays of Ukraine,
      Armenia, Belarus, Romania, Russia, Georgia, Moldova and parts of Bulgaria,
      as well as Turkey, Iran and the Assyrian–Chaldean–Syriac diaspora. Due to
      its geographical closeness, it is also widespread in Slovakia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Especially made for Easter, pască is a tart with a cozonac dough base
      filled with fresh cheese like urdă or cottage cheese, raisins, eggs and
      sugar. Other variants include sour cream, chocolate, or berries fillings.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>For the dough you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Active dry yeast</b> – You can use instant yeast if that’s what you
        have. If you use instant, you won’t need to bloom it first, but it’s a
        good idea to test if it’s still alive. If your yeast doesn’t foam up
        your yeast is dead and the bread won’t turn out.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Water</b> – The water is used to bloom our yeast. Make sure it’s
        lukewarm – you can test with your finger. It needs to be warm to the
        touch, not hot. If it’s too hot it will kill the yeast.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Milk</b> – I used whole milk (3.25%) but you can use whatever is in
        your fridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Butter</b> – I only use unsalted butter. This way I have full control
        over the sodium in my recipes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lemon zest</b> – I know 2 tablespoons seems like a lot, but this
        recipe makes a pretty large pasca. The lemon is what really makes this
        bread taste so incredible! You can, of course, add less or more
        depending on your tastes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sugar</b> – This bread is meant to have a touch of sweetness. You can
        add a little more or less if you’d like.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>All-purpose flour</b> – You can use bread flour for this recipe if
        you’d like. The difference is that you’ll get a bit more gluten
        formation. If you use gluten-free flour, make sure to get a protein such
        as xanthan gum to replace the gluten.
      </li>
      <li><b>Eggs</b> – Use large eggs for this recipe.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Vanilla</b> – The way the vanilla warms up the lemon zest is just
        irresistible!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the filling you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ricotta cheese</b> – You can use a low-fat ricotta if you’d like.
        Since this is the star of the show for your filling, getting a good
        quality ricotta will taste so amazing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sugar</b> – You can adjust the amount of sugar in the filling to suit
        how sweet you’d like it to be.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Eggs</b> – The eggs are used to bind the filling and keep everything
        together without spilling out when you slice the pasca.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lemon zest</b> – The lemon makes the flavor of this filling really
        pop! You can add more or less zest if you’d like.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Vanilla</b> – Just like in the dough, the vanilla tastes incredible
        paired with the lemon zest in your filling.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Bloom the yeast: </b>Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. You can
        add a tablespoon of sugar from the sugar needed for the dough to help
        activate the yeast. Let it sit for 10 minutes until it has foamed up
        nicely. If your yeast doesn’t get foamy, don’t move forward. Buy a new
        jar and store it in the freezer so it lasts longer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Dissolve the sugar: </b>In a saucepan, add the milk, butter, lemon
        zest, sugar, and vanilla. Stir over medium heat just until the sugar
        dissolves a bit. We don’t want the mixture to boil or get too hot. It
        should just be warm to the touch. Remove from heat and whisk in the
        eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Finish the dough: </b>Add the flour, yeast mixture, and milk mixture
        to the bowl of your mixer. Knead it with the dough hook for about 5
        minutes until it’s soft and elastic. Remove the dough, spritz the bowl
        with cooking oil, place the dough back in, cover with a clean kitchen
        towel, and let the dough rise until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Make the filling: </b>Whisk the filling ingredients together, cover
        with plastic wrap, and store in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Assemble the pasca: </b>Split the dough into 4 equal-sized pieces.
        Spritz them with some cooking spray so they don’t dry out. Roll one of
        the pieces out until it’s about 10″ in diameter. Split the other 3
        pieces in half, and roll each piece into a 36″ long rope. Read below for
        instructions on braiding the ropes. Wrap the braid around the edge of
        the 10″ rolled circle of dough. Pour the filling into the center, and
        leave the pasca to rise for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bake the pasca: </b> While you wait for your bread to rise, preheat
        the oven to 350F. Brush with egg wash then bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or
        until nicely browned. The centre will still be a bit jiggly when you
        take it out.
      </li>
    </ol>
